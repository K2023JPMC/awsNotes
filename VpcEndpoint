***VPC endpoint***
-VPC endpoints allow a VPC to connect to the following:
-AWS Services
  -S3 or DynamoDB
-AWS Partner Services 
-Other VPCs
---------------------
-Endpoints are higly available, higly redundant and scalable virtual devices

-Two types of endpoints

  Gateway Endpoints;
      - High speed security to AWS services
      - Places a route in touring table
      - Amazon S3 Endppoints
        -Allows private access from your vpc to S3
        -When you careate an endpoint for S3 a prefix list and VPC endpoint are created
      - The prefix list will adhere to this naming convention : -pl-xxxxxxxx
      - The routing table will show for rout/prefix
          pl-xxxxxxxx
      - the route to the vpc endpoint will be in the routing table
Gateway Endpoint Security
      - Endpoing policies can be setup to limit resources that are avaibable from the endpoint
        - i.e S3 Bucket

      - Limit routing information to subnets that need access to the endpoint
        -if you dont have a route in the routing table you cant reach it

  Interface Endpoints
      - Interface endpoints are a way to connect to certain AWS services and external organizations 
        - EC2 systems managere, Kinesis, ELB APIs
        - External services hosted by AWS parteners or custimers in their own VPCs
      - Interface endpoints are local to the VPC
      - Interface endpoints are effectively an ENI in your VPC
      - When you create the endpoint AWS will generate an AWS endpoint specific DNS name so you can connect to the endpoint via its DNS name
      - Interface endppoints use AWS Private Link
      - Virtual private line over the AWS network
      - Private link creates an elastic network interface
      - Restricts all traffic between the VPC and the AWS or Customer or Partner Organization
      * Privatge Link Vs VPC Peering
        -Private link allows access to a very specific service
        -VPC peering allows access to all the services that you allow
        -VPC peering allows a moderate number of connections(125)
        -Private link is much more scalable
        -Limites are based upon the max throughput achieved by your load balancers and servers
        -Private link solves the address problem when connecting to external VPCs
        -Private link uses NAT So there is no need to worry about overlapping address space
