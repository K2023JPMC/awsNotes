Secuirty Groups

* Security Groups act as virtual firewalls for your AWS resources (eg. EC2 instances).
* They control inbound and outbound traffic to the resources.
* Security Groups are defined by allowing or denying specific IP ranges or protocols
* They are network-level controls, not related to permissions or roles

IAM Roles

* IAM Roles define a set of permissions for your AWS services to perform actions on your behalf
* Roles are identity-based permissions used for secure access control (e.g., EC2 instance can assume a role to access to S3 Bucket).
* IAM Roles do not interact with Secuirty Groups

How They Work Together

You cannot assign an IAM Role to a Secuirty Groups directly, but you can assign a role to an application or instance (e.g., EC2 instance) and attache the Secuirty group to that instance.

Example Setup:

1. Create Secuirty Group

* Allow HTTO(80) and HTTPS (443) traffic for a web application.
* Deny all other inbound traffic.

2. Create an IAM Role:

* Grant the application permission to access an S3 bucket or DynamoDb Table

3. Launch an EC2 Instance

* Attach the IAM Role to the EC2 Instance.
* Assign the Security Group to control traffic to/from the instance
